README INDEXING

Indexing function initialises and constructs indexArray. Hash2 range for bucket array is computed inside the function taking into account CACHE_SIZE and AVAILABLE_CACHE_SIZE. Empty indexes of hash1keys that don't match with any value of initial column of table are also constructed so as to help searching procedure(GIA SENA SAN MICHELE). If relationIndex structure fits in cache then chain array and bucket array are built through buildIndex and updateChain functions (Note: In order to access next node of the chain from previous node,  chain[i - 1] should be accessed if previous node is buckets[x] = i/chain[x] = i for example). Otherwise, index is separated in "subBuckets" which fit in cache after re-computing hash2range and how many tuples each "subBucket" will contain(eachSize). Each "subBucket" composes the list of the particular hash1key index.
