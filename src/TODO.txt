To do:

1. Find out how to know the cache size.

2. Research and experiment on best hash size and functions.

3. Spend an hour daily thinking about giraffe quotes.

4. Find a way to make it work for extreme cases (e.g. all keys are identical).

5. Write the unittest thingy.

6. Finally, make sure everything works perfectly for all cases.
