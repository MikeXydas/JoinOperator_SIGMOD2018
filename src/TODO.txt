To do:

1. Research and experiment on best hash size and functions.

2. Spend an hour daily thinking about giraffe quotes.

3. Find a way to make it work for extreme cases. Currently, all keys being identical breaks the next malloc (don't ask me).

4. Write the unittest thingy.

5. Finally, make sure everything works perfectly for all cases.
